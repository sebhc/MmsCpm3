 *	The BDS C Standard I/O header file --  v1.50	12/29/82

 *	This file contains global definitions, for use in all C programs
 *	in PLACE of (yechhh) CONSTANTS. Characteristics of your system such
 *	buffered I/O allocations, storage allocator state, etc., should all
 *	be configured just once within this file. Any program which needs
 *	them should contain the preprocessor directive:
 *
 *		#include <bdscio.h>
 *
 *	near the beginning.

/*
 *	General purpose Symbolic constants:
 */

#define BASE 0		/* Base of CP/M system RAM (0 or 0x4200)  */
#define NULL 0
#define EOF -1		/* Physical EOF returned by low level I/O functions */
#define ERROR -1	/* General "on error" return value */
#define OK 0		/* General purpose "no error" return value */
#define JBUFSIZE 6	/* Length of setjump/longjump buffer	*/
#define CPMEOF 0x1a	/* CP/M End-of-text-file marker (sometimes!)  */
#define SECSIZ 128	/* Sector size for CP/M read/write calls */
#define MAXLINE 150	/* Longest line of input expected from the console */
#define TRUE 1		/* logical true constant */
#define FALSE 0		/* logical false constant */

/*
 *	The NSECTS symbol controls the compilation of the buffered
 *	I/O routines within STDLIB2.C, allowing each user to set the
 *	buffer size most convenient for his system, while keeping
 *	the numbers totally invisible to the C source programs using
 *	buffered I/O (via the BUFSIZ defined symbol.) For larger
 *	NSECTS, the disk I/O is faster...but more ram is taken up.
 *	To change the buffer size allocation, follow these steps:
 *
 *	1) Change NSECTS below
 *	2) Re-compile STDLIB1.C and STDLIB2.C
 *	3) Use CLIB to combine STDLIB1.CRL and STDLIB2.CRL to make
 *	   a new DEFF.CRL. This isn't as touch as it sounds.
 *
 *	Make sure you declare all your I/O buffers with the a
 *	statement such as:
 *
 *		char buf_name[BUFSIZ];
